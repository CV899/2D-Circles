# Geometric-Shapes
Creates and compares different geometric shapes using various properties.

<i>Specifications:</i>

<b>Circle2D.java</b>

  • Two double data fields named x and y that specify the center of the circle with set and get methods.
  • A data field radius with a set and get method.
  • A no-arg constructor that creates a default circle with (0, 0) for (x, y) and 1 for radius.
  • A constructor that creates a circle with the specified x, y, and radius.
  • A method getArea() that returns the area of the circle.
  • A method getPerimeter() that returns the perimeter of the circle.
  • A method contains(double x, double y) that returns true if the specified point (x, y) is inside
  this circle. See the Figure (a) below.
  • A method contains(Circle2D circle) that returns true if the specified circle is inside this circle. See
  See the Figure (b) below.
  • A method overlaps(Circle2D circle) that returns true if the specified circle overlaps with this circle.
  See the Figure (c) below.
  
 <b>Triangle.java</b>
 
  • Three double data fields named side1, side2, and side3 with default values 1.0 to denote three sides of
     the triangle.
  • A no-arg constructor that creates a default triangle.
  • A constructor that creates a triangle with the specified side1, side2, and side3.
  • The accessor methods (set and get methods) for all three data fields.
  • A method named getArea() that returns the area of this triangle.
  • A method named getPerimeter() that returns the perimeter of this triangle.
  • A method named toString() that returns a string description for the triangle.
